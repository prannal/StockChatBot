# Stock Chat Bot

The Stock ChatBot is a simple chatbot. This ChatBot help user to get Stock information such as stock rate detail, stock company detail and all other stock related information that it want.
User get this information by using just one inquiry message i.e. If customer ask as “search price detail of AAPL[symbol] stock.” then it get all price rate(open, close, high, low, etc.) of given stock symbol. Or if customer ask such as “search all detail of AAPL [symbol] company detail.” then this stock chatbot gives all stock company related information like that company official website, it’s stock symbol, description, sector and many more things. If User want both company and price detail of stock by it’s symbol name then that thing is achieved by using Herocard.For meeting all this we required to integrated our stock chatbot with LUIS app using Microsoft Visual Studio 2017.

### Prerequisites

The minimum prerequisites to run this sample are:
* The latest update of Visual Studio 2017. You can download the community version [here](http://www.visualstudio.com) for free.
* The Bot Framework Emulator. To install the Bot Framework Emulator, download it from [here](https://emulator.botframework.com/). Please refer to [this documentation article](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-emulator/wiki/Getting-Started) to know more about the Bot Framework Emulator.


#### LUIS Application

The first step to using LUIS is to create or import an application. Go to the home page, www.luis.ai, and log in. After creating your LUIS account you'll be able to Import an Existing Application where can you can select a local copy of the LuisBot.json file an import it.

![Import an Existing Application](images/prereqs-import.png)

If you want to test this sample, you have to import the pre-build [LuisBot.json](LuisBot.json) file to your LUIS account.

Once you imported the application you'll need to "train" the model ([Training](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/luis/train-test)) before you can "Publish" the model in an HTTP endpoint. For more information, take a look at [Publishing a Model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/luis/publishapp).

Finally, edit the [RootLuisDialog.cs](Dialogs/RootLuisDialog.cs#L14) file and update the LuisModel attribute placeholders with the values corresponding to your Subscription and Application.


````C#
    ...
    using Microsoft.Bot.Builder.Luis.Models;
    using Microsoft.Bot.Connector;

    [LuisModel("YourModelId", "YourSubscriptionKey")]
    public class RootLuisDialog : LuisDialog<object>
    {
    ...
````

#### Where to find the Application ID and Subscription Key

You'll need these two values to configure the LuisDialog through the LuisModel attribute:

1. Application ID

    In the LUIS application's dashboard, you can copy the App ID from the address bar.
    
    ![App Settings](images/id.png)
    
2. Subscription Key

    Once your app is published, copy the subscription key from the application resources on the Publish App page.

### Code Highlights

One of the key problems in human-computer interactions is the ability of the computer to understand what a person wants, and to find the pieces of information that are relevant to their intent. In the LUIS application, you will bundle together the intents and entities that are important to your task. Read more about [Planning an Application](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/LUIS-api/documentation/Plan-your-app) in the LUIS Help Docs.
Check out the use of LuisIntent attributes decorating [RootLuisDialog](Dialogs/RootLuisDialog.cs#L55) methods to handle LUIS Intents, for instance `[LuisIntent("search.price")]`.

````C#
[LuisIntent("search.price")]
public async Task price(IDialogContext context, IAwaitable<IMessageActivity> activity, LuisResult result)
{
    ...
}
````

Each intent handler method accepts the `IDialogContext`, the original incoming `IMessageActivity` message and the `LuisResult` including the matching Intents and Entities for the LUIS query. In the sample below, the [RootLuisDialog](Dialogs/RootLuisDialog.cs#L73) class retrieves a stock price from the processed [pre-built entity](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/LUIS-api/documentation/Pre-builtEntities).

````C#
EntityRecommendation cityEntityRecommendation;

if (result.TryFindEntity(EntityGeographyCity, out stockEntityRecommendation))
{
    stockEntityRecommendation.Type = "symbol";
}
````

You might notice the use of `EntityRecommendation.Type = "symbol"` in the code above. This is useful to map entity values to properties when reusing the LUIS captured entities for the (Dialogs/RootLuisDialog.cs#L51). The properties mapped to entities will be pre-populated. 

````C#
var hotelsFormDialog = new FormDialog<HotelsQuery>(hotelsQuery, this.BuildHotelsForm, FormOptions.PromptInStart, result.Entities);
````

In addition, the `AirportCode` entity makes use of the LUIS Pattern Features which helps LUIS infer entities based on an Regular Expression match, for instance, Airport Codes consist of three consecutive alphabetic characters. You can read more about Pattern Features in the [Add Features](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/LUIS-api/documentation/Add-Features#pattern-features) section of the LUIS Help Docs.

![Edit Regex Feature](images/highlights-regex.png)

Another LUIS Model Feature used is Phrase List Features, for instance, the model includes a phrase list named Near which categorizes the words: near, around, close and nearby. Phrase list features work for both words and phrase and what LUIS learns about one phrase will automatically be applied to the others as well.
> Note: Both RegEx and Phrase List are transparent from the Bot's implementation perspective. Think of model features as "hints" used by the Machine Learning algorithm to help categorize and recognize words that compound Entities and Intents.

> **Limitations**  
> The functionality provided by the Bot Framework Activity can be used across many channels. Moreover, some special channel features can be unleashed using the [ChannelData property](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/dotnet/bot-builder-dotnet-channeldata).
> 
> The Bot Framework does its best to support the reuse of your Bot in as many channels as you want. However, due to the very nature of some of these channels, some features are not fully portable.
> 
> The features used in this sample are fully supported in the following channels:
> - Skype
> - Facebook
> - Microsoft Teams
> - DirectLine
> - WebChat
> - Slack
> - GroupMe
> 
> They are also supported, with some limitations, in the following channels:
> - Kik
> - Email
> 
> On the other hand, they are not supported and the sample won't work as expected in the following channels:
> - Telegram
> - SMS
